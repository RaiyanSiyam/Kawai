                <p>It was the first time she sat behind me on the bike. I prepared for this day for a long time 
                   by taking my friends and cousins as pillions while riding as I am not a regular rider.</p>

                <h2>Our First Andolon Together</h2>
                <p>Didn't want to take her with me but she being the most adamant person ever would've gone without me if I didn't take her with me. 
                   I was scared to shit for her though she is braver and stronger than me.</p>
